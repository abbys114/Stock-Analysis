# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Through this project, we were able to help Steve expand the dataset to include the whole stock market, rather then a dozen stocks.  This research will better help Steves parents decide on stocks to invest in based on there performance over the last few years.  To expand the dataset, we refactored the codes we originally made to help them run fater and more efficiently.  Overall,  the data shows analysis to more stocks and runs more efficiently to help Steve's parents make the best decison on investing.

## Results

### Stock Performance
Over all, the stock performance for 2017 and 2018 performed poorly with negative returns.  As seen in the charts below, only two stocks had positive returns for both 2017 and 2018 of the stocks we analyzed.  These stocks were ENPH and RUN.  Given this information, Steve should consider investing in these stocks for his parents.

### Execution Times 
When compared to the original VBA script, our refactored codes ran faster.  This shows that when codes are refactored, they run more efficiently.  This saves us time and makes it easier to use for us and fuure users.  The exxecution times for the refatored codes for 2017 and 2018 can be seen in the images below.
