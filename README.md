# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Through this project, we were able to help Steve expand the dataset to include the whole stock market, rather then a dozen stocks.  This research will better help Steves parents decide on stocks to invest in based on there performance over the last few years.  To expand the dataset, we refactored the codes we originally made to help them run fater and more efficiently.  Overall,  the data shows analysis to more stocks and runs more efficiently to help Steve's parents make the best decison on investing.
