# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Through this project, we were able to help Steve expand the dataset to include the whole stock market, rather then a dozen stocks.  This research will better help Steves parents decide on stocks to invest in based on there performance over the last few years.  To expand the dataset, we refactored the codes we originally made to help them run fater and more efficiently.  Overall,  the data shows analysis to more stocks and runs more efficiently to help Steve's parents make the best decison on investing.

## Results

### Stock Performance
Over all, the stock performance for 2017 and 2018 performed poorly with negative returns.  As seen in the charts below, only two stocks had positive returns for both 2017 and 2018 of the stocks we analyzed.  These stocks were ENPH and RUN.  Given this information, Steve should consider investing in these stocks for his parents.

### Execution Times 
When compared to the original VBA script, our refactored codes ran faster.  This shows that when codes are refactored, they run more efficiently.  This saves us time and makes it easier to use for us and fuure users.  The execution times for the refatored codes for 2017 and 2018 can be seen in the images below.

## Project Summary

### Pros and Cons of Refractoring Code
There are advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code in general.  Some pros to refactoring code are that it makes the code run more efficiently.  This includes faster run time and requring the use of less memory space.  Refactoring also makes the code more user freiendly, which will help the creators use it and any other future user.  There are also disadvantages to refactoring code, which include that it is more time consuming.  If on a tight schedule, refactoring may not be an option.  Also, refactoring could open up oppurtunities for bugs to come in.  This would create more issues and involve more time eliminating the bugs.  Overall, refactoring makes code running more efficient, but it may not always be necessary. 

### Pros and Cons Applied to Refactoring the Original VBA Script
Refactoring the original VBA Script had its advantages and disadvantages.  It allowed us to analyze more stocks rather then only a dozen stocks. This gave Steve more analysis to better help his parents invest in the stock market.  It also made our codes more efficient, which decreased there run times.  A disadvantage to refactoring the original script, is that it took more time.  In this case we had the time to rafactor the code, and it led to a more in depth analysis for Steve, so overall, refactoring was advantageous in this situation.
